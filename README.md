## Intro
- As cyber threats rapidly increase, security requirements are tightening across industries.  
- Even early-stage startups are increasingly being asked by partners and clients to provide **`security certifications`**.

---

## Problem
1. **Low Security Capability (Startups & Non-IT Teams)**
    - Limited resources (Budget, Human resource)
    - Lack of security problem-framing and communication skills
    - No internal security response system

2. **Lack of Actionable Follow-ups**
    - AI or tools may identify risks, but companies don’t know what to do next.

3. **Limitations of Existing Services**
    - One-way risk reports → user churn (exit)
    - No continuous risk tracking → forgotten after one-time use
    - No interactive or conversational support

4. **Poor UX**
    - Existing interfaces are not user-friendly for non-developers or security non-specialists.
