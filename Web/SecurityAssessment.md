## 🧭 8. Recommendations

### 🔒 Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)
- 🚫 Block public access on all S3 buckets (Critical)
- 🔐 Enforce MFA for admin and privileged access via Okta
- ⚙️ Apply JSON schema validation to all public API endpoints
- 🧾 Validate third-party webhooks (e.g., Stripe HMAC)

### 🔁 Mid-Term (30-60 Days)
- 📚 Centralize logs via ELK / CloudWatch with alert rules
- 🧪 Conduct a tabletop incident response drill
- 🔍 Run weekly dependency and container scans (auto CI/CD)

### 📘 Long-Term (Quarterly Goals)
- 🧱 Full ISO 27001 alignment and SOC 2 readiness program
- ⚖️ Automate third-party security and legal reviews
- 🧩 Add Zero Trust layer between services (VPC Lattice / Istio)
