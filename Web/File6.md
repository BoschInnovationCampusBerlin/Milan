    User Base: Who are the primary users of this application (e.g., public, internal employees, authenticated customers, specific roles)? What is the estimated number of users?

2. Application Scope and Boundaries

    URLs/Domains in Scope: What are all the primary and secondary URLs or domains associated with this web application that are to be included in the assessment?

    Excluded Components: Are there any specific parts, modules, APIs, or sub-domains of the application that are explicitly out of scope for this assessment? If so, why?

    Integration Points/Dependencies: Does the web application integrate with any other internal systems, external APIs, third-party services, or payment gateways? If yes, please list them and briefly describe the nature of the integration.

    Data Flow: Describe the typical data flow through the application from user input to backend processing and storage.

    Data Types & Sensitivity: What types of data does the application process, store, or transmit? What is the sensitivity level of this data (e.g., public, internal, confidential, Personal Identifiable Information (PII), Sensitive PII, financial data)?

3. Technology Stack & Architecture

    Frontend Technologies: What technologies are used for the frontend (e.g., React, Angular, Vue, plain HTML/CSS/JS)?

    Backend Technologies: What programming languages, frameworks, and web servers are used on the backend (e.g., Node.js, Python/Django/Flask, Java/Spring, PHP/Laravel, ASP.NET)?

    Database Technologies: What type of database(s) does the application use (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQL Server)?

    Deployment Environment: Where is the application hosted? (e.g., Cloud provider - AWS/Azure/GCP, On-premise, Managed hosting). Specify specific services used (e.g., EC2, Lambda, Kubernetes, App Service).

    Containerization/Orchestration: Is the application containerized (e.g., Docker)? Is an orchestration platform used (e.g., Kubernetes, ECS)?

    CI/CD Pipeline: Describe the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline used for deployment. Are security checks integrated into this pipeline?

4. Authentication & Authorization

    Authentication Methods: How do users authenticate to the application (e.g., username/password, OAuth, SSO via SAML/OpenID Connect, MFA, API Keys)?

    Password Policy: If username/password, what are the password complexity, length, and expiry requirements? Are passwords hashed and salted?

    MFA: Is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implemented and, if so, for which user roles or functionalities?

    Session Management: How are user sessions managed (e.g., tokens, cookies)? Are sessions short-lived? Are session IDs regenerated on login?

    Authorization Model: How does the application control what authenticated users can access or do (e.g., Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), ACLs)?

    Privileged Accounts: Are there any highly privileged accounts (e.g., admin accounts)? How are these accounts managed and protected?

5. Input & Output Handling

    Input Validation: How is user input validated on both the client-side and server-side? Are all untrusted inputs validated (e.g., against length, type, format, range)?

    Output Encoding: How is dynamic content encoded before being displayed to users to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?

    Error Handling: How does the application handle errors? Are detailed error messages, stack traces, or system information exposed to users?

    File Uploads: If file uploads are allowed, what measures are in place to secure them (e.g., file type validation, size limits, antivirus scanning, safe storage)?

6. Data Protection

    Data at Rest Encryption: Is sensitive data encrypted when stored in databases, file systems, or backups?

    Data in Transit Encryption: Is all sensitive data encrypted when transmitted over networks (e.g., using HTTPS/TLS)? Which TLS versions are supported/enforced?

    Key Management: How are encryption keys managed and protected?

    Data Minimization: Is data collected and stored only for as long as necessary and relevant for its purpose?

    Data Anonymization/Pseudonymization: Are sensitive data fields anonymized or pseudonymized where possible?

7. Configuration & Deployment Security

    Default Configurations: Are all default vendor configurations and credentials changed (e.g., for databases, web servers, frameworks)?

    Hardening: What hardening measures have been applied to servers, databases, and the application itself?

    Secrets Management: How are sensitive credentials, API keys, and database passwords stored and accessed (e.g., environment variables, secret management services)?

    Patch Management: What is the process for applying security patches to the operating system, web server, database, and application dependencies?

8. Logging & Monitoring

    Logging: What types of security-relevant events are logged (e.g., authentication attempts, authorization failures, data access, critical errors)?

    Log Retention: How long are logs retained, and where are they stored?

    Monitoring: Are logs actively monitored for suspicious activity? Is there an alerting mechanism for security incidents?

    Audit Trails: Are there clear audit trails for administrative actions or sensitive data modifications?

9. Security Testing & Practices

    Security Testing: What security testing has been performed on the application (e.g., Penetration Testing, Vulnerability Scans, Code Review, DAST, SAST, Bug Bounty)?

        When was the last test conducted?

        What were the key findings, and have they been remediated?

    Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC): Are security considerations integrated into your development lifecycle? (e.g., security requirements, threat modeling, secure coding guidelines).

    Developer Training: Do developers receive regular training on secure coding practices?

    Incident Response: Is there an incident response plan in place specifically for this web application? How are security incidents reported and handled?

10. AI/ML Specifics (if applicable)

If your web application incorporates AI/ML components, please consider these additional questions:

    AI Model Security: How is the integrity and confidentiality of the AI model protected (e.g., during training, deployment, inference)?

    Training Data Security: How is the training data secured against tampering, unauthorized access, or poisoning?

    Adversarial AI Concerns: Have you considered potential adversarial attacks (e.g., model evasion, data poisoning, model inversion) and how the application mitigates them?

    Explainability/Transparency: Is there a mechanism to understand or explain AI decisions, especially if critical or sensitive?

This questionnaire covers a broad range of typical web application security aspects. The more detailed and accurate the responses, the more effective your AI tool will be in generating a comprehensive risk assessment document.
