# NIS2 (Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems)

## 1. Executive Summary for Product Owners

**The Bottom Line:** If your product is considered part of a "critical" or "important" sector in the EU (like energy, transport, health, or key digital services like cloud computing or online marketplaces), NIS2 imposes strict cybersecurity requirements. It's no longer enough to just have security; you must actively manage risk, have robust incident response plans, and secure your entire supply chain. This directive holds management personally accountable for compliance.

## 2. What It Covers (The Details)

NIS2 is the successor to the original NIS directive and significantly broadens its scope and strengthens its requirements. It aims to achieve a higher common level of cybersecurity across the EU.

*   **Cybersecurity Risk Management:** It mandates a comprehensive risk management approach. This isn't just about firewalls; it's about policies, procedures, and controls covering:
    *   Risk analysis and information system security policies.
    *   Incident handling (prevention, detection, and response).
    *   Business continuity and crisis management (e.g., system recovery after an incident).
    *   **Supply Chain Security:** You are responsible for the security of your direct suppliers and service providers.
*   **Reporting Obligations:** Stricter and more detailed incident reporting rules:
    *   **Early Warning:** Within 24 hours of becoming aware of a significant incident.
    *   **Incident Notification:** A more detailed report within 72 hours.
    *   **Final Report:** A comprehensive report within one month.

## 3. Who Does It Apply To? (The Scope)

NIS2 expands the list of covered sectors and removes the distinction where Member States designate companies. If you are in a listed sector and meet the size-cap rule (generally medium-to-large enterprises), you are covered.

*   **Sectors Covered:** The list is long and divided into "essential" and "important" entities. Examples include:
    *   **Essential:** Energy, Transport, Banking, Health, Drinking Water, Digital Infrastructure (Cloud providers, Data Centers, DNS services).
    *   **Important:** Postal services, Waste Management, Manufacturing of critical products, Digital Providers (Online marketplaces, search engines, social networking platforms).
*   **Key Question:** Is your product a foundational service that other businesses or society rely on? If yes, you need to check if you fall under NIS2.

## 4. Key Obligations & Requirements

*   **Management Accountability:** Top management must approve and oversee cybersecurity risk-management measures and can be held personally liable for breaches of the directive.
*   **Minimum Security Measures:** You must implement a baseline of security measures, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), data encryption, personnel training, and access control policies.
*   **Vulnerability Handling:** You must have policies and procedures for handling and disclosing cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
*   **Supply Chain Diligence:** You must assess and manage the cybersecurity risks posed by your suppliers (e.g., the security of a third-party library or a cloud service you use).

## 5. Actionable Questions for Your Team

*   **Applicability:** "Does our service fall into any of the NIS2 sectors? Are we a 'digital service provider' like a cloud platform or online marketplace?"
*   **Risk Management:** "What is our formal process for identifying and assessing cybersecurity risks to our product? Is it documented? Who in management has signed off on it?"
*   **Incident Response:** "Does our incident response plan meet the 24-hour/72-hour reporting timeline? Have we ever practiced it?"
*   **Supply Chain:** "What are our critical third-party dependencies (e.g., cloud hosts, APIs, software libraries)? How are we assessing *their* security posture?"
*   **Backlog:** "Do we need to create epics or stories for implementing specific security controls required by NIS2, like stronger access controls or vulnerability disclosure programs?"
