## 4. Threat Model
_Identify threats using a framework (e.g., STRIDE). List threats, affected components, and mitigations._

| Category   | Example Threat           | Affected Component | Mitigation                  |
|------------|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Spoofing   | [e.g., Fake webhooks]   | [API Gateway]      | [HMAC signature validation] |
| Tampering  | [e.g., Param injection] | [Backend APIs]     | [Input validation, WAF]     |
| ...        | ...                     | ...                | ...                         |

---

## 5. Risk Assessment
_List and rate risks by likelihood, impact, and status._

| # | Risk Description                | Likelihood | Impact | Level     | Status           |
|---|---------------------------------|------------|--------|-----------|------------------|
| 1 | [e.g., Public S3 bucket access] | High       | High   | Critical  | Open             |
| 2 | [e.g., Missing MFA for admin]   | High       | High   | Critical  | Planned          |
| ... | ...                           | ...        | ...    | ...       | ...              |

## 6. Security Evaluation
_Evaluate key security domains. Use status icons and comments._

| Domain                | Status                | Comments                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| IAM                   | [‚úÖ/‚ö†Ô∏è/‚ùå]            | [e.g., RBAC in place, MFA pending]       |
| Data Protection       | [‚úÖ/‚ö†Ô∏è/‚ùå]            | [e.g., AES-256, S3 policy audit needed]  |
| Logging & Monitoring  | [‚úÖ/‚ö†Ô∏è/‚ùå]            | [e.g., Lacks log centralization]         |
| ...                   | ...                   | ...                                      |

## 7. Compliance Mapping
_Map controls to frameworks (NIST, SOC 2, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, etc.)._

| Control Area         | Maturity | Notes                                 |
|---------------------|----------|---------------------------------------|
| NIST 800-53 (MOD)   | [e.g., 80%] | [e.g., Logging, IAM gaps]           |
| SOC 2 (Security)    | [e.g., 75%] | [e.g., Partial log coverage]        |
| PCI DSS (Subset)    | [e.g., 70%] | [e.g., S3 access, MFA gaps]         |
| ISO 27001           | [e.g., 60%] | [e.g., Policy automation pending]   |

---

## 8. Recommendations
_Provide prioritized, actionable recommendations. Group by short-term, mid-term, long-term._

### üîí Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)
- [e.g., Block public S3 access (Critical)]
- [e.g., Enforce MFA for admin accounts]

### üîÅ Mid-Term (30-60 Days)
- [e.g., Centralize logs, conduct IR drill]

### üìò Long-Term (Quarterly Goals)
- [e.g., Full ISO 27001 alignment, Zero Trust]
